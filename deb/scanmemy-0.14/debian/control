Description: Dummy package to fulfill package dependencies
 This is a dummy package that makes Debian's package management
 system believe that equivalents to packages on which other
 packages depend on are actually installed.  Deinstallation of
 this package is only possible when all pending dependency issues
 are properly resolved in some other way.
 .
 Please note that this is a crude hack and if thoughtlessly used
 might possibly do damage to your packaging system.  And please
 note as well that using it is not the recommended way of dealing
 with broken dependencies.  It is better to file a bug report.
